This is an experimental application using [[https://langchain.com/][LangChain]] to collect [[https://news.ycombinator.com/][Hacker News]] stories that I think will be of interest.
By =scripts/update.py=, [[examples/favorite-hacker-news-stories.org][./examples/favorite-hacker-news-stories.org]], which is written in Emacs Org format, would be populated with information on the top stories of Hacker News, along with reviews by ChatGPT.

If you are interested, you can follow these steps to see how it works:

1. Build the image
   #+begin_src shell
   docker build -t $(basename $(pwd)) .
   #+end_src

2. Setup .envrc
   #+begin_src shell
   cp .envrc.sample .envrc
   vi .envrc  # Set up necessary environment variables
   #+end_src

31. Execute =scripts/update.py=
    #+begin_src shell
    make shell
    python -m scripts.update --org-path examples/favorite-hacker-news-stories.org
    #+end_src
