** Summary
The article provides instructions on how to run Llama 13B, a text prediction model similar to GPT-2, with a 6GB graphics card. The latest change in llama.cpp allows users to pick an arbitrary number of transformer layers to be run on the GPU, which is perfect for low VRAM. The article also includes steps to apply for research access to the llama model and perform the conversion process to create a prompt file and run the model. The process uses about 5.5GB of memory.

** Summary
The 16-meter-long RIME antenna on ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) has finally been successfully deployed after being stuck for three weeks due to a jammed pin. The flight control team used various methods to try to shift the pin, including shaking Juice using its thrusters and warming it with sunlight. The antenna was finally released when a mechanical device called a 'non-explosive actuator' was fired, allowing the antenna to unfold. RIME will be used to study the surface and subsurface structure of Jupiter's icy moons down to a depth of 9 km.

** Summary
The "Techlash" phenomenon, which describes rising hostility towards tech, may have been primarily a media phenomenon rather than a reflection of the American public's sentiment towards tech. While the average American likes using tech products, the media has seen a decline in positive coverage of tech companies, coinciding with Facebook's revenue surpassing newspaper advertising revenue in 2013. The turn against tech by some parts of the Democratic Party may also be due to tech's economic attacks on traditional left power centers, undercutting their prestige and influence, and pulling away their top talent.

** Summary
The article discusses the benefits of using a frontend framework for reactivity and composability in web development. It explains how frameworks like Vue and React allow for easier manipulation of HTML and JavaScript code, and how reactivity and composability are achieved through these frameworks. The article also introduces the concept of Proxy objects in JavaScript, which can be used to listen for changes in data and update the UI automatically. The author suggests that modern Web APIs can achieve these benefits without the need for complex frameworks and dependencies.

** Summary
Northwestern Medicine scientists have used a novel, skull-implantable ultrasound device to open the blood-brain barrier and repeatedly permeate large, critical regions of the human brain to deliver chemotherapy that was injected intravenously. The four-minute procedure to open the blood-brain barrier is performed with the patient awake, and patients go home after a few hours. The results show the treatment is safe and well tolerated, with some patients getting up to six cycles of treatment. This is the first study to successfully quantify the effect of ultrasound-based blood-brain barrier opening on the concentrations of chemotherapy in the human brain.

The article argues that the instruction set architecture (ISA) of a CPU, whether it is ARM or x86, is not a significant factor in determining performance. Instead, the design of the CPU and its ability to efficiently process data and predict instructions is what matters. The article cites research and comments from experts to support this claim and notes that both ARM and x86 CPUs can be optimized for either low power or high performance.

** Summary
A study using data from China has found that species with greater potential height, smaller leaf size, and diverse human utilization attributes have the highest probability of long-term persistence as old trees in human-dominated landscapes. The study also revealed that the persistence probabilities of human-associated species were relatively high in intensively cultivated areas, while the persistence probabilities of spontaneous species were relatively high in mountainous areas or regions inhabited by ethnic minorities. The study highlights the potential impacts of human activities on the long-term persistence of trees and the associated shifts in species composition in human-dominated landscapes.

** Summary
Off-grid solar systems are bringing limited access to electricity to remote villages in Indonesia, providing more hours in the day, more income, and more social gatherings. Before electricity came to these villages, the day ended when the sun went down, but now villagers can continue their work and children can study at night. Hundreds of millions of people globally lack access to electricity, and off-grid solar programs could be replicated across Indonesia to bring renewable energy to remote communities. Grassroots organizations are helping to provide imported home solar systems, which can power light bulbs and charge cellphones, for monthly payments.

** Summary
Combinatory logic is a logical theory that simplifies the problem of substitution by using combinators to eliminate bound variables. It has applications in computer science and mathematics, and can formalize recursive functions and arithmetic. Combinatory logic is also connected to nonclassical logics via typing and can emulate lambda-abstraction. It is susceptible to Gödel-type incompleteness theorems and is an archetypical term rewriting system.

** Summary
XState is a JavaScript and TypeScript library for creating finite state machines and statecharts for modern web applications. It adheres to the SCXML specification and offers a range of packages, templates, and examples. The library can be used with React, Vue, Svelte, and Solid, and includes a visualizer for modeling and inspecting statecharts. Statecharts are a formalism for modeling stateful, reactive systems, and XState offers a declarative way to describe application behavior.

** Summary
"The Cathedral and the Bazaar" is an essay by Eric Steven Raymond that analyzes the success of the open-source project, fetchmail, and compares the "cathedral" model of software development with the "bazaar" model used in the Linux world. Raymond argues that the bazaar model, which involves releasing early and often and allowing many developers to contribute, is more effective at debugging software. He concludes that "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" and explores the implications of this insight for the future of software development.

** Summary
The Dual LLM pattern is proposed as a solution to the prompt injection class of security vulnerabilities in AI assistants. The article discusses the use of tools by Large Language Models (LLMs) and the categories of attack that need to be addressed. The proposed solution involves creating two LLMs, one with privileged access to tools and the other quarantined from them. However, the article warns that social engineering attacks can still be a vulnerability and that gating actions on human approval may not be effective.

** Summary
The Arthropod head problem is a long-standing dispute in zoology concerning the segmental composition of the heads of various arthropod groups and how they are evolutionarily related to each other. The dispute has historically centered on the exact make-up of the insect head but has been widened to include other living arthropods and fossil forms. The topic has been based on insect embryology, but in recent years, a great deal of developmental molecular data has become available. The precise nature of the labrum and the pre-oral region of arthropods remains highly controversial.

** Summary
The Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU) was an experimental cultural theorist collective formed in 1995 at Warwick University, England. Their work combined elements of cyberpunk and Gothic horror with critical theory, esotericism, numerology, and demonology. They were known for their concept of hyperstition, which involved the experimental science of self-fulfilling prophecies. The CCRU drew inspiration from various sources, including Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus, H. P. Lovecraft, William Gibson, J. G. Ballard, and Carl Jung. The CCRU dissolved in 2003 and was never a sanctioned academic project, according to Warwick University.

** Summary
The Pfeilstorch, or "arrow stork," is a stork that has been injured by an arrow while wintering in Africa and returns to Europe with the arrow still stuck in its body. The first and most famous Pfeilstorch was found in 1822 near the German village of Klütz, carrying a spear from central Africa in its neck. This discovery was crucial in understanding the migration of European birds, as before migration was understood, people struggled to explain the sudden annual disappearance of birds like the white stork and barn swallow. The Rostocker Pfeilstorch in particular proved that birds migrate long distances to wintering grounds. As of 2003, about 25 Pfeilstörche have been documented in Germany.
