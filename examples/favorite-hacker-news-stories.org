** Summary
"Successful Lisp" is a book that provides an overview of Common Lisp for working programmers, introducing key concepts in an easy-to-read format and describing the format, typical use, and possible drawbacks of all important Lisp constructs. It also provides practical advice for the construction of Common Lisp programs, shows examples of how Common Lisp is best used, and illustrates and compares features of the most popular Common Lisp systems on desktop computers. The book includes discussion and examples of advanced constructs for iteration, error handling, object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces, and threading, and supplements Common Lisp reference books and manuals with useful hands-on techniques.

** Summary
The interactive application firewall OpenSnitch package in Debian is now ready for use after some delays due to missing packages. The latest fixes are now available for Debian Bookworm, and a bug in the package dependencies has been fixed. The package is still unable to build its eBPF module within Debian, but it has already proven its worth in discovering surprising connections from programs believed to work offline. Users can test the package by installing it with "apt install opensnitch" in Bookworm. Bitcoin donations are accepted for support.
