** Summary
The article provides instructions on how to run Llama 13B, a text prediction model similar to GPT-2, with a 6GB graphics card. The latest change in llama.cpp allows users to pick an arbitrary number of transformer layers to be run on the GPU, which is perfect for low VRAM. The article also includes steps to apply for research access to the llama model and perform the conversion process to create a 4bit model. Finally, it provides instructions on how to create a prompt file and run the model.

** Summary
The 16-meter-long RIME antenna on ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) has finally been successfully deployed after being stuck for three weeks due to a jammed pin. The flight control team used various methods to try to shift the pin, including shaking Juice using its thrusters and warming it with sunlight. The antenna was finally released when a mechanical device called a 'non-explosive actuator' was fired, allowing the antenna to unfold. RIME will be used to study the surface and subsurface structure of Jupiter's icy moons down to a depth of 9 km.

** Summary
The article discusses the benefits of using a frontend framework for reactivity and composability in web development. It explains how frameworks like Vue and React allow for easier manipulation of HTML and JavaScript code, and how reactivity and composability are achieved through these frameworks. The article also introduces the concept of Proxy objects in JavaScript, which can be used to listen for changes in data and update the UI automatically. The author suggests that modern Web APIs can achieve these benefits without the need for complex frameworks and dependencies.

** Summary
Northwestern Medicine scientists have used a novel, skull-implantable ultrasound device to open the blood-brain barrier and repeatedly permeate large, critical regions of the human brain to deliver chemotherapy that was injected intravenously. The four-minute procedure to open the blood-brain barrier is performed with the patient awake, and patients go home after a few hours. The results show the treatment is safe and well tolerated, with some patients getting up to six cycles of treatment. This is the first study to successfully quantify the effect of ultrasound-based blood-brain barrier opening on the concentrations of chemotherapy in the human brain.

The author reflects on their past behavior of being highly critical of other programming languages and developers, perpetuating a culture of contempt in the tech industry. They were called out on their behavior and realized the harm it caused to those from minority backgrounds. The author acknowledges that intent does not excuse the harm caused and that perpetuating contempt was a means of acquiring credibility and avoiding difficult introspection. They urge for a change in the culture of the tech industry to be more inclusive and accepting of diverse backgrounds and narratives.
