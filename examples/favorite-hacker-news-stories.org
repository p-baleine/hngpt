** Summary
"Successful Lisp" is a book that provides an overview of Common Lisp for working programmers, introducing key concepts in an easy-to-read format and describing the format, typical use, and possible drawbacks of all important Lisp constructs. It also provides practical advice for the construction of Common Lisp programs, shows examples of how Common Lisp is best used, and illustrates and compares features of the most popular Common Lisp systems on desktop computers. The book includes discussion and examples of advanced constructs for iteration, error handling, object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces, and threading, and supplements Common Lisp reference books and manuals with useful hands-on techniques.

** Summary
The interactive application firewall OpenSnitch package in Debian is now ready for use after some delays due to missing packages. The latest fixes are now available for Debian Bookworm, and a bug in the package dependencies has been fixed. The package is still unable to build its eBPF module within Debian, but it has already proven its worth in discovering surprising connections from programs believed to work offline. Users can test the package by installing it with "apt install opensnitch" in Bookworm. Bitcoin donations are accepted for support.

** Summary
Tweag Services has worked with Mercury to improve the speed of Haskell code compilation by making targeted improvements to the mechanism by which GHC emits compiled code. The native code generator (NCG) spends a surprisingly large amount of its time writing ASCII text, and GHC was using its internal SDoc abstraction to print assembly code, which was causing a significant amount of time and memory to be spent printing code. The improvements have resulted in a 2-3% reduction in compile times and a 5-10% reduction in allocations for unoptimized builds.

** Summary
The article discusses the benefits of using a frontend framework for reactivity and composability in web development. It explains how frameworks like Vue and React allow for easier manipulation of HTML and JavaScript code, and how reactivity and composability are achieved through these frameworks. The article also introduces the concept of Proxy objects in JavaScript, which can be used to listen for changes in data and update the UI automatically. The author suggests that modern Web APIs can achieve these benefits without the need for complex frameworks and dependencies.

** Summary
Donald Knuth and Doug McIlroy were asked to write a program to print the k most common words in a text file. Knuth wrote a clever program in WEB, while McIlroy wrote a concise program using Unix commands. The story illustrates the differences between the two approaches and highlights the Unix philosophy, but it may be unfair to Knuth as he was trying to demonstrate his ideas on Literate programming.
